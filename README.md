# Python-data-analysis-journey



Perfect! Here’s a professional yet friendly LinkedIn post you New Journey Unlocked!

I’m excited to share that I’ve officially started learning Python programming and Data Analysis! 

As a Metallurgical & Materials Engineering student, I believe that blending engineering principles with data-driven decision-making is a powerful path toward real-world impact — and I’m ready to take that step!

🔍 From writing my first lines of code to working with real data sets, I’ll be documenting every stage of my growth.

📅 Starting next Monday, I’ll be sharing my weekly progress and lessons learned — one step at a time.
Whether it’s a challenge, a project, or a simple “aha!” moment, I’ll post updates every Monday to stay accountable and hopefully inspire others too.

If you’ve been thinking of starting something new — this is your sign. Let’s grow together !!
